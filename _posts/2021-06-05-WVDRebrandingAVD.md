<!--more-->
CAE is implemented by enabling services, like Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, and Teams, to subscribe to critical events in Azure AD so that those events can be evaluated and enforced near real time. Critical event evaluation does not rely on Conditional Access policies so is available in any tenant. The following events are currently evaluated:

#### Enhanced support for Azure Active Directory (coming soon in public preview) ####

+ Azure Active Directory is a critical service used by organizations around the world to manage user access to important apps and data and maintain strong security controls. We are pleased to announce that youâ€™ll soon be able to join your Azure Virtual Desktop virtual machines directly to Azure Active Directory (AAD) and connect to the virtual machines from any device with basic credentials

#### Manage Windows 10 Enterprise multi-session virtual machines with Microsoft Endpoint Manager (available now in preview) ####

+ Microsoft Endpoint Manager allows you to manage policies and distribute applications across devices.
